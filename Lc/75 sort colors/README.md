Given an array with n objects colored red, white or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white and blue.
<br/>
Here, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue respectively.
<br/>
Note: You are not suppose to use the library's sort function for this problem.
<br/>
Example:
<br/>
Input: [2,0,2,1,1,0]<br/>
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]
